When netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method 'File.createTempFile' on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions '-rw-r--r--'. Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information. This is the case in netty's 'AbstractDiskHttpData' is vulnerable. This has been fixed in version 4.1.59.Final.

When netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method 'File.createTempFile' on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions '-rw-r--r--'. Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information. This is the case in netty's 'AbstractDiskHttpData' is vulnerable. This has been fixed in version 4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own 'java.io.tmpdir' when you start the JVM or use 'DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)' to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.",

When netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method 'File.createTempFile' on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions '-rw-r--r--'. Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information. This is the case in netty's 'AbstractDiskHttpData' is vulnerable. This has been fixed in version 4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own 'java.io.tmpdir' when you start the JVM or use 'DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)' to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.",

When netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method 'File.createTempFile' on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions '-rw-r--r--'. Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information. This is the case in netty's 'AbstractDiskHttpData' is vulnerable. This has been fixed in version 4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own 'java.io.tmpdir' when you start the JVM or use 'DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)' to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.",

When netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method 'File.createTempFile' on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions '-rw-r--r--'. Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information. This is the case in netty's 'AbstractDiskHttpData' is vulnerable. This has been fixed in version 4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own 'java.io.tmpdir' when you start the JVM or use 'DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)' to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.",

It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code shouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk would usually be replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, an XML converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, for example, and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence.

This only applies when lxml is used together with libxml2 2.9.10 through 2.9.14. libxml2 2.9.9 and earlier are not affected. It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code shouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk would usually be replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, an XML converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, for example, and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence. If untrusted input is received (also remotely) and processed via iterwalk function, a crash can be triggered.",

When netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method 'File.createTempFile' on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions '-rw-r--r--'. Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information. This is the case in netty's 'AbstractDiskHttpData' is vulnerable. This has been fixed in version 4.1.59.Final.
